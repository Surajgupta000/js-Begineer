//data types are categorsied by means of storing and accessing the data by which we can difference them in primitive and non primitive
//primitive datatypes: call by value 

//7 types: when we access the primitive datatypes we get the copy of the datatypes and any changes done only in the copy
// string, number, boolean, null(pura khali), undefined( under value nhi h), symbol, BigInt

// Dynamically-typed languages are those (like JavaScript) where the interpreter assigns variables a type at runtime based on the variable's value at the time.
// refernce type(non primitive)

//Arrays, objects, (to master js then master the object in js and web events in js), functions

const id= Symbol('123')
const anotherid= Symbol('123')
console.log(id=== anotherid);
